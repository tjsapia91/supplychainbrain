# SupplyChainBrain
This is Tommy's operational brain for his role as Supply Chain Manager at Michael Todd Beauty — an $80M beauty company managing 3 brands across multiple sales channels with international expansion on the horizon. This brain is built to organize chaos, track what matters, and make Claude an effective supply chain thinking partner.

Syncs between: Personal machine (Obsidian vault) ↔ Work machine (Claude Code)

## ⚠️ SESSION SYNC RULE
At the end of every session, update this file's Current Status section with what changed.

This brain is used from both personal and work machines. Neither Claude instance shares memory — this file IS the shared memory. Before ending any session:

- Update "Current Status" with what was done
- Push changes: `git add . && git commit -m "description" && git push origin main`
- On the other machine: `git pull` to get the updates

If you are Claude and the user is ending the session, remind them to let you update this file and push first.

## Claude's Role
Claude operates here as a supply chain operations partner — part analyst, part strategist, part automation builder. The job is to help Tommy manage complexity across 3 brands, multiple channels, multiple 3PLs, and a growing international footprint.

- **Demand planning partner** — help analyze forecasts, spot trends, flag risks across brands and channels
- **Process builder** — help document and improve SOPs as Tommy learns and optimizes the role
- **Tool builder** — help build and improve AI-powered tools (ERP, dashboards, automation) that reduce the number of screens Tommy needs to look at
- **Strategic thinker** — help think through vendor decisions, 3PL transitions, international expansion logistics
- **Dashboard consolidator** — Tommy is drowning in dashboards (SoStocked, Sellerboard, SAP, Valogix, TrueOps, Excel). Help centralize and simplify.
- **Knowledge capture** — as Tommy learns this role, help him document what he's learning so nothing gets lost

If a session is drifting without moving toward clearer operations, better systems, or concrete next actions — nudge me back: *"What's the one thing that moves the supply chain forward today?"*

## Rules & Conventions
- **(C) prefix** — Files created by Claude are prefixed with `(C)` so it's clear they're AI-generated.
- **Editing rule** — Before editing any file without the `(C)` prefix, ask for permission first.
- **Work in small steps.** Don't dump walls of information. Each thing needs to register.
- **Be blunt.** If a process is inefficient, say so. If I'm overcomplicating something, call it out.
- **Brand abbreviations** — Use MTB, NFMD, SS when referring to brands.
- **Skills** — All reusable scripts/automations are saved as markdown files in the Skills folder, NOT as Claude Code skills.

### ✅ Completed April 27

**Repo Restructure:**
- ✅ **Moved all scripts to `scripts/`** — demand_planning.py, build_report.py, build_action_plan.py, combine_forecast.py, run_weekly_supply_chain_analysis.py, generate_weekly_excel.py
- ✅ **Moved all docs to `docs/`** — WEEKLY_CHECKLIST.md, SoStocked_Full_Automation_Agent.md, and other reference files
- ✅ **Dated output subfolders** — all outputs now save to `outputs/YYYY-MM-DD/` (e.g. `outputs/2026-04-27/`)
- ✅ **Fixed BASE path** in all scripts: `BASE = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))` — scripts work from any location after the move
- ✅ **UTF-8 fix** — added `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")` to prevent Windows cp1252 crashes on emoji output

**SKU Review Integration:**
- ✅ **`load_sku_review()` function** in demand_planning.py — reads `sku-review-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx`, returns inactive_asins, phase_out_asins, replenish_notes (ASIN → col N text)
- ✅ **Inactive items fully excluded** from all report sheets (not shown anywhere)
- ✅ **Phase-out items fully excluded** from all report sheets (deplete and done, no PO recommended)
- ✅ **Replenish From column (col N)** injected as `replenish_source` field — flows through JSON into all Excel sheets
- ✅ **ABC classification** added to dashboard priority table

**DOS Formula Fix — AWD Inbound:**
- ✅ **`load_awd_inbound()` function** — reads `reports/seller-central/awd-*.csv` (skiprows=3), maps ASIN → "Inbound to AWD (units)"
- ✅ **DOS formula updated**: `total_stock = fba_market + wh_stock (AWD available) + awd_inbound (AWD in transit)`
- ✅ **Validated**: Soniclear Elite White Marble corrected from DOS 69 (CRITICAL, Jul 5) → DOS 131 (HIGH, Sep 5) after including 4,872 AWD inbound units. 0 formula errors across all 177 items.

**Report Design Improvements:**
- ✅ **FBA Pipeline column** — condensed 3 in-transit columns (Inbound Shipped, At FC Pending, AWD→FBA Outbound) into one "FBA PIPELINE" display column in all sheets. Underlying data still in JSON.
- ✅ **New 📊 Weekly Summary sheet** — first sheet in weekly-report Excel. Shows KPI tiles, brand breakdown (SS/MTB/NFMD), priority items section, high items section, FBA replen section. Single-page executive view.
- ✅ **`build_executive_summary()` function** added to build_report.py

**Action Plan Script:**
- ✅ **`build_action_plan.py` built** — reads filled sku-review + demand plan JSON, generates 3-tab action plan Excel:
  - 🚚 ShipBob Send-ins — FBA replenishment from ShipBob
  - 📦 Supplier POs — purchase orders to place with manufacturers
  - ⚫ Inactive & Phase Out — no action needed
- ✅ **Nova Pink special case** — 700 units from ShipBob first, balance (~137 units) on Supplier PO
- ✅ **Saved to**: `outputs/2026-04-27/action-plan-2026-04-27.xlsx`

**ShipBob Item Reference:**
- ✅ **BODYBRBLK recorded** — Soniclear Replacement Body Brush Head (ASIN B07D2HWLPM) = ShipBob item **859886007791**. Updated in sku-review-2026-04-27.xlsx col N and flows through to replenish_source in all reports.

---

### ⚠️ CRITICAL VELOCITY FIX (Apr 20 — still applies)
SoStocked velocity columns (Adj. Velocity, 30 Day Velocity) are already in **units/day** — NOT monthly totals. Do NOT divide by 30.

---

### ⚠️ AWD INBOUND NOW IN DOS FORMULA (Apr 27)
AWD inbound units (in transit from supplier → AWD) are now included in total_stock for DOS calculation. Source: `reports/seller-central/awd-*.csv`. This is an ASIN-level number — CA market rows share the same AWD inbound figure, which may slightly inflate CA DOS. Watch for this.

---

### What Still Needs to Be Done

**Agent / Automation:**
- [ ] **Schedule the agent** — set up Monday 8am recurring trigger via Windows Task Scheduler
- [ ] **Test full agent run on Windows machine end-to-end** — verify PowerShell paths, Python env, all 6 downloads

**ShipBob Item References — Resolved Apr 27:**
All SB item numbers confirmed = UPC barcode (same as SAP item no.). Source: `Downloads/Amazon SKU Numbers In SAP (1).xlsx` + sku-review col F.

| Product | ASIN | ShipBob Item No. (UPC) | Updated in sku-review |
|---|---|---|---|
| Soniclear Replacement Body Brush Head | B07D2HWLPM | 859886007791 | ✅ |
| Sonicblend Replacement Head | B07CRS2PDJ | 859886007739 | — |
| NOVA Serum Infusion Head | B01ND4R0NU | 859886007722 | — |
| Sonicblend Display Cradle | B07D2JYZ2V | 859886007043 | — |
| Soniclear Elite White Marble | B08WB2L1M1 | 811573030093 | — |
| LUMOS | B0DCQTWWHN | 811573031397 | — |
| Sonicsmooth Pro+ White | B0D1GLNW5C | 811573031366 | — |
| Pulverizador (NANO MISTER) | B09B16JH5G | 850026141306 | ✅ |
| Sonicsmooth Hair Identifier Spray | B0DSLQKVVL | 811573031410 | ✅ |

**Data Gaps:**
- [ ] **Cost / Unit blank** — PO $ value = $0 across all items. Enter costs in SoStocked OR build SAP cost lookup.
- [ ] **CA AWD inbound double-counting** — AWD inbound is ASIN-level, applied to both US and CA rows. May inflate CA DOS. Monitor.
- [ ] **Inbound to FBA (46,129 units)** — Verify in SAP whether this is a real MTB PO in transit. If not, this was SoStocked aggregate bleed (previously excluded from formula — now irrelevant since we use AWD inbound instead).
- [ ] Clean up SoStocked regional groupings (22 issues previously flagged)
- [ ] Get MTB and NFMD forecast files from SoStocked (for future PO qty refinement)

**Reporting:**
- [ ] Decide final design for Django Reports Hub (need DOS/SVP input)
- [ ] Add `--json` flag to analyze_sostocked.py for Django integration

### Scripts — What Each Does (Updated Apr 27)

All scripts now live in `MTB-SupplyChain\scripts\`. Run from the repo root:
```
cd C:\Users\Tom Sapia\MTB-SupplyChain
python scripts\demand_planning.py
python scripts\build_report.py
python scripts\build_action_plan.py
```

**`demand_planning.py`** ← PRIMARY SCRIPT
- Input: Weekly Forecast (`reports\weekly\Weekly_Forecast_*.xlsx`) + AWD inbound CSV (`reports\seller-central\awd-*.csv`) + filled SKU review (`outputs\YYYY-MM-DD\sku-review-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx`)
- Output: `outputs\YYYY-MM-DD\demand-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx` + `.json` + `.md`
- Does: DOS calc (FBA + AWD available + AWD inbound), PO qty, urgency tiers, excludes inactive/phase-out

**`build_report.py`**
- Input: `demand-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.json` from dated output folder
- Output: `outputs\YYYY-MM-DD\weekly-report-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx` (5 sheets + 📊 Weekly Summary)
- Does: Formats Excel dashboard with executive summary, priority actions, inventory overview

**`build_action_plan.py`**
- Input: `sku-review-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx` + `demand-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- Output: `outputs\YYYY-MM-DD\action-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx` (3 tabs)
- Does: Translates SKU review decisions into ShipBob send-ins, Supplier POs, Inactive/Phase-out list

**`combine_forecast.py`**
- Input: 6 individual SoStocked CSV downloads in `reports\sostocked\`
- Output: Combined `Weekly_Forecast_*.xlsx` in `reports\weekly\`

---

### Required Input Files (Weekly)

| File | Source | Drop Into |
|---|---|---|
| Weekly Forecast (all 3 brands) | SoStocked → 6 brand/market exports → combine_forecast.py | `reports\weekly\` |
| AWD Inbound report | Amazon Seller Central → AWD → Inventory → Export | `reports\seller-central\` |
| SKU Review (filled in) | Tommy fills out sku-review sheet from prior run | `outputs\YYYY-MM-DD\` |

---

### Formula (Locked In — Updated Apr 27)
```
Days of Supply = (FBA Stock + AWD Available Stock + AWD Inbound) ÷ Adj. Velocity

Order Qty = daily_velocity × (lead_time_days + 60 buffer_days) − total_stock

NOTE: Adj. Velocity and 30 Day Velocity from SoStocked are already in units/day. Do NOT divide by 30.
Fallback: if Adj. Velocity = 0, use 30 Day Velocity.
AWD Inbound source: reports/seller-central/awd-*.csv, col "Inbound to AWD (units)", skiprows=3
```

**Urgency tiers:**
- 🚨 AMAZON STOCKOUT — FBA=0 but warehouse stock exists (replenish FBA)
- 🔴 TRUE STOCKOUT — no stock anywhere (new PO needed)
- 🔴 CRITICAL — DOS ≤ lead time (at reorder point)
- 🟠 HIGH — DOS ≤ lead time + 30 days
- 🟡 FBA REPLENISHMENT — FBA empty but ShipBob stock > 30 days (routine send-in)
- 🟢 HEALTHY — DOS > lead time + 30 days
- 🔵 LOW VEL STOCKOUT — stocked out but velocity < 0.1/day (tracked, not a PO emergency)
